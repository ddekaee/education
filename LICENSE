NOTES AND GUIDANCE
===============================================================

1. **How this dual-license works:**
   - Downstream users MAY CHOOSE EITHER license (MIT OR CC BY 4.0) and must
     follow the terms of the chosen license.
   - You DO NOT have to comply with *both* licenses — pick one.

2. **Why use dual-license "MIT OR CC BY 4.0":**
   - MIT is simpler and more permissive (common for software/code).
   - CC BY 4.0 is more typical for creative works, text, e-books, and other
     content where explicit attribution is desired.
   - Giving both lets developers choose the permissiveness they need.

3. **Attribution examples (when using CC BY 4.0):**
   - Short inline attribution (e.g., README or footer):  
     `© 2025 Arya Deka Al-Hadid — Licensed under MIT OR CC BY 4.0`
   - Full recommended attribution block:
